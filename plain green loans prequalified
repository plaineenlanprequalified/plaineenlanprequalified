Student loans aren't predatory in the same way other types of lending can be, but these loans can still wreak havoc on your finances. This is especially true if you overborrow for a degree that doesn't have a solid return on investment (ROI), or if you find yourself unable to repay your loans but also unable to discharge them in bankruptcy.

Then again, federal student loans have IDR plans with monthly payments as low as $0 for those who qualify. These plans can be a lifeline for borrowers who have low incomes and can qualify for affordable monthly payments, and the benefits apply regardless of the loan balance.
